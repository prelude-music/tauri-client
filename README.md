# Prelude (Webview)
The Prelude music player, but in a Tauri Webview App.

### Development
<small>requires a prelude server in the background</small>

Preferably use `pnpm`, but `npm` as well as `yarn` should work too.
```sh
pnpm install

npm install
```

Run the app via `tauri dev`,
e.g.
```sh
pnpm run tauri dev
```
